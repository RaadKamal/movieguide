# COMP 3350 Semester Project

The purpose of this project is to create a Android application for Nexus 7 tablet while learning the standards of
software development. We were given groups to work with as a team for the entire semester, held weekly meetings, and
submitted three iterations of our MovieGuide app. The final version of this project was released on April 25th 2022
at 4:30PM.

## Brief Overview

Our MovieGuide shows users a list of movies that they might want to watch based on their preferences. To use this app
you can search for movies using search terms. You can also filter on genre, release date, country of origin, PG rating
and/or 5 star score. Another way to find a good move is to use the newly implemented quiz feature. Take a short quiz
and get a list of around ten movie based on the quiz question. Users can also create a account that saves their
preferred genres. 

## How to run the app

To run the app, please clone the main branch of this repository that contains the iteration 3 release of our project.

From command line, this can be done by navigating to a folder of your choice and executing this command:

git clone https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a02/group-3/movie-recommendation-app.git

Then, open the project in android studio, gradle build, and run the app on a Nexus 7 tablet emulator.
